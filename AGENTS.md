# Repository working rules

## Commit ownership

The user has explicitly assigned backend implementation to Soumik, and all backend
tests, the entire frontend and frontend tests to Deepthi. These assignments
override balancing decisions. Keep related fixes with the assigned owner.

Before every commit, invoke a decision agent using `prompts/commit-owner.md`.
Supply only the proposed diff, feature key, `review-ownership.json`, and relevant
local history. Use a small, low-cost agent for this narrow decision. The main
implementation agent must not bypass this step or choose an author directly.

Apply the returned owner to both Git author and committer:

- 1: `soumik15630m <soumik15630m@gmail.com>`
- 2: `deepthimuthu77 <deepthimuthu77@gmail.com>`

Keep fixes, tests, refactors, and quality improvements with the existing feature
owner. Balance new independent work by estimated review effort. Related ownership
takes precedence over balance. Record assignments in `review-ownership.json`.

If the decision requires splitting, split the changes and rerun the decision for
each commit. If more context is needed, gather it and rerun; ask the user only
when a material ownership ambiguity remains. Handle routine assignments without
asking the user. If the decision agent is unavailable, leave changes uncommitted
until it can run; never silently substitute a direct author choice.

## Commit format and scope

- Commit messages must be one line, without coauthor or attribution trailers.
- Create local commits only. Never push to a remote.
- Keep code comments sparse and focused on non-obvious intent.
